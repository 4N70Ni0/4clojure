4Clojure is a website to help beginners learn to program in Clojure through interactive problems.  Users are asked to fill-in-the-blanks for progressively harder problems.

This site is a very early stage of development, so there is not a lot of polish yet.  Any interested in contributing should check out the "Issues" page for ideas on what to work on.

Installation should be pretty simple:

1) Install Leiningen
2) Install MongoDB
3) lein repl
4) (use 'foreclojure.data-set)
5) (load-problems)
6) (run)
