<br /><br />
Especially exciting is that we will be running a couple of contests to get free tickets to Clojure/West!
The first contest will be three days long, from Friday, January 20th (12:01 AM Pacific time) to Sunday, January 22nd (11:59 PM Pacific time). If you submit the best new problem (judged by the 4Clojure site administrators) during the contest perdiod, you will receive a free ticket to Clojure/West, or a refund if you have already purchased your ticket."}}
